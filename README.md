## Converting Berkeley Madonna to mrgsolve
The .Rmd file provided is an attempt to convert Berkeley Madonna model files
to mrgsolve models.  The code is based on simple heuristics and patterns rather 
than any method parsing and deconvolution to abstract syntax tree.

This is work in progress, so please feel free to try it, hack at it and 
provide comments back.
